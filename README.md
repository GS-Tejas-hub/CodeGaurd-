## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js and npm (or yarn)
-   Python 3.7+ and pip
-   Java (for running JPlag)
-   Git

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/GS-Tejas-hub/CodeGaurd-.git
    cd CodeGaurd-
    ```

2.  **Install frontend dependencies:**
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Install backend dependencies:**
    ```bash
    cd ../backend
    pip install -r requirements.txt 
    ```
    *(Note: A `requirements.txt` file may need to be created from the imports in the python files)*

4.  **Download JPlag:**
    Download the latest `jplag.jar` from the [official JPlag repository](https://github.com/jplag/jplag/releases) and place it in the `backend` directory.

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the backend server:**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    uvicorn main:app --reload
    ```
    The backend will be running at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

2.  **Start the frontend development server:**
    In a new terminal:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm run dev
    ```
    The frontend will be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

1.  Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.
2.  Choose your preferred method for submitting code (zip, URL, or paste).
3.  Upload or paste the code and start the analysis.
4.  Once the analysis is complete, you can view the results and download a PDF report.
